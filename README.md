- Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/project. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest. 
- Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count. 
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. 
- This year, the first 55,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

## Rules To Contribute To This Repo

-   You can write solutions only in C++ for Data Structure and Algorithms (if you dont know C++ you can submit only algorithm) 
-   Follow file naming convention for all your pull requests.
-   while adding any content it should be inside its appropiate directory
-   if there is any  problem with inaccurate solution create a issue 

## file naming convention

 use | file type  |  comments
 ----|------------|---------------
 questions | **README.md**        | all questions of particular topic are mentioned in a `README.md` file inside the sub topic folder 
 C++ solutions | **[topic name].cpp**  | solution C++ code file code to a question is written in same folder where question is mentioned
 algorithm solution | **[topic name]-algorithm.txt** | algorithm solution to a question is written in a `.txt` txt file in same folder where question is mentioned
 technical writing | **[topic name]-content.md** or **[topic name]-content.txt** | technical content can be provided in simple `.txt` text document inside [technical writing folder](https://github.com/Sushreesatarupa/DSA-cpp-Hacktoberfest2021/tree/main/technical%20writings)  you can also style it up and submit a `.md` file if you are aquainted with markdown language
    
## Things you can contribute to 
-   You can add a solution to a question ( present in the readme of particular topic folder) that is unanswered

The project has two parts: 
1. C++
    - C++ section will contain folders of all the data structures and algorithms topics with some pre-addressed questions. 
    - Participants can solve problems and send pull requests. Participants can even add questions and solutions of their interest.
    - There will be a technical writing section in which participants can contribute their technical writing on any topic of c++ and data structures.
    - The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general-purpose languages - C++.
    - Well-documented source code with detailed explanations provides a valuable resource for educators and students alike.

2. The webpage -( readme hosted ) 
    - There shall be showcasing Daily tasks from Day 1 to Day 60. 
    - And a section to showcase technical writings of participants in the form of blogs

### FEATURES
1. Beginner-friendly
2. Targeted for developers, content writers, and programming enthusiasts.
3. Would also help participants who are not familiar with development but are eager to participate in open source.
